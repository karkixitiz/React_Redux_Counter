## Increment And Decrement Couter
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]. I do practice on how to create action, how to create reducer, how to dispatch action from component and how reducer change the state of the application. Applied "window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()" dev tool in store to view changing status of state in chorm.
